**To run, follow these steps:**

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` in this directory (make sure it creates a local node_modules)
2. By default, it uses the local version from `src` of react-router-redux, so you need to run `npm install` from there first. If you want to use a version straight from npm, remove the lines in `webpack.config.js` at the bottom.
3. Build with `webpack --watch`
4. Open `index.html`
